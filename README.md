ðŸ§  Full-Stack Realtime Chat App
This project is a full-stack real-time chat application built using NestJS for the backend and Flutter for the frontend. It features a complete user authentication system using JWT, secure email verification during signup, and real-time communication powered by WebSockets. The backend is structured with clean, modular architecture and leverages TypeORM with Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) for persistent data management.

The Flutter frontend interacts with the backend using RESTful APIs and includes a clean UI with basic accessibility features such as copy/paste, intuitive feedback messages, and a responsive layout. Authentication flows are fully integrated, including token storage and protected route access, ensuring a seamless login and session experience for users.

The chat functionality is handled via sockets, enabling real-time message updates and dynamic user interactions. Additional features include multi-step signup with code verification via email (using Google Mail services), modular user management, and server-side rendering logic where applicable. The app is structured for scalability and maintainability, making it easy to extend with more advanced features in the future.

This project demonstrates strong integration between modern full-stack technologies and real-time communication logic, offering a solid foundation for production-grade chat or messaging systems.
